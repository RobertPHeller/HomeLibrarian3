The {\em Home Librarian} system maintains a database of ``cards'',
which describe books, magazines, video and audio tapes, CDs, record
albums, laser disks, and other similar items. Version 3 of the system
uses a relational database backend (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL
Server, or SQLite). It connects to the backend database via a ODBC
driver library, so any backend database system that has a ODBC driver
library can be used.  The system uses two database tables, a table of
cards and a table of keywords.  The system also hooks into Amazon's
database using Amazon Web Services.

This version of the {\em Home Librarian} system is
written entirely in Tcl\footnote{It does use some standard C coded
extensions.} and there is no longer any C or C++ code. The system is
also built using Starpacks, so there is no need to install any system
support software either, since the executable program is completely
self contained.

If you have {\em any} comments about this package, please let me know.
My contact information is shown on the back side of the title page.
I would be very interested in any comments users of the {\em Home
Librarian} package might have.
