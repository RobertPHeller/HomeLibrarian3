\section{Database Structure}

Each card uses string of up to 36 characters as a unique key.
Cards are indexed by key, title, author, and subject. The keys, titles,
authors, and subjects are always compared in a case-insensitive
fashion.  That is, {\tt "The Door Into Summer"} is the same as {\tt
"THE DOOR INTO SUMMER"}.  Internally, the keys, titles, authors, and
subjects are converted to all uppercase letters.  There is also a
keyword table that associates keywords (search terms) with each card.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{3in}|}
