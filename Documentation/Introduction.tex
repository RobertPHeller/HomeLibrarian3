\section{What Is the \thesystem?}

\subsection{Basic Terminology}

The {\em Home Librarian} package uses a database of ``cards'' that
concisely describe items in your library, such as books, magazines,
records, and tapes. The cards contain information such as the title of
the item, the author (or performer) of the material, the publisher, the
date of publication, and so on. The cards can be search by their unique
keys, or by title, author, or subject.  There is also a keyword table
that associates keywords with cards.

\section{How this Manual Is Organized}

There are two main chapters, the Chapter~/ref{chpt:Reference} is the
Reference Manual and Chapter~/ref{chpt:Tutorial} is the Tutorial.
