DESCRIPTION
===========

The Home Librarian package uses a database of "cards" that concisely
describe items in your library, such as books, magazines, records, and
tapes. The cards contain information such as the title of the item, the
author (or performer) of the material, the publisher, the date of
publication, and so on. The cards can be search by their unique keys,
or by title, author, or subject.  There is also a keyword table that
associates keywords with cards.

Database Structure
------------------

Each card uses string of up to 36 characters as a unique key. Cards are
indexed by key, title, author, and subject. The keys, titles, authors,
and subjects are always compared in a case-insensitive fashion.  That
is, "The Door Into Summer" is the same as  "THE DOOR INTO SUMMER". 
Internally, the keys, titles, authors, and subjects are converted to
all uppercase letters.  There is also a keyword table that associates
keywords (search terms) with each card.

HISTORY
=======

This is the third incarnation of this project.  The first was
collection of CLI / Termcap programs written in C++.  The second was a
Tcl/Tk and C++ GUI hybrid program.  This third version is a pure Tcl/Tk
GUI program, using a RDBMS backend.  This version is still early beta
release.  Somethings are not yet working fully (the whole print
sub-system needs a lot of work yet).
